  - buckle up, we're gonna start drawing <actual pixels> to the screen! 🖥️
  - but first we need to learn some things
  - you'll see... it's all about timing ⏱️
  - 🚲  cycles, 🌠  scanlines, and 🖼️  frames!
  responses:
  - what do you mean? [wdym]
  - <<level.isCompleted || m.$exercise>> 📚  take me to the action [next]

wdym:
  messages:
  - 📈  the NEEES generates a 60FPS video signal
  - 🖼️  each <frame> is a 256x240 image (think of it as a pixel grid)
  - 🌠  a <scanline> would be one row of that grid
  - 🚲  oh, and each scanline takes 341 PPU <cycles> to render
  responses:
  - and... what's a cycle? 🚲 [cycles]

cycles:
  messages:
  - each operation that the PPU does takes a certain amount of time, which we measure in <cycles>
  - these are just fractions of a second, and a lot happens in a single cycle!
  - the PPU can read or write data, or even draw a pixel on the screen 🎨
  responses:
  - (*) are PPU cycles the same as CPU cycles? 🤔 [same]
  - how does the drawing work? 🖌️ [drawing]

same:
  messages:
  - conceptually, yes, but the 🖥️  PPU runs 3x faster than the 🧠  CPU
  - so PPU cycles are faster (each PPU cycle is, in time, ~1/3~ of a CPU cycle)
  responses:
  - ...cycles

drawing:
  messages:
  - it draws from top to bottom, one scanline at a time, one pixel per cycle
  - the first 240 scanlines make up the visible part of the picture
  - there are also some extra non-visible scanlines, which gives the PPU some time to rest 🏖️
  responses:
  - what do you mean by "time to rest"? [vblank_hblank]

vblank_hblank:
  messages:
  - during each scanline (after it has drawn all the pixels), it gets a small break known as the Horizontal Blank, or <HBlank>
  - and at the end of all visible scanlines, it gets a longer break, the Vertical Blank, or <VBlank> 🏝️
  - during these periods, the PPU isn't drawing any pixels, and that gives the program a chance to update the screen
  responses:
  - got it, what's next? [next]

  messages:
  - 📚  create a file somewhere for the PPU code
  - |-
    it should export a class like this:
      ```javascript
      export default class PPU {
        constructor(cpu) {
          this.cpu = cpu;

          this.cycle = 0;
          this.scanline = -1;
          this.frame = 0;
        }
      }
      ```
  - |-
    and add this method (for now, it'll just keep track of the timing):
      ```javascript
      step() {
        this.cycle++;
        if (this.cycle >= 341) {
          this.cycle = 0;
          this.scanline++;

          if (this.scanline >= 261) {
            this.scanline = -1;
            this.frame++;
          }
        }
      }
      ```
  - then, import that file from 📄  ~/code/index.js~
  - and add a `PPU` key (pointing to that class) to the exported object
  responses:
  - why does the scanline counter start at -1? 😕 [minus1]

minus1:
  messages:
  - the scanline ~-1~ (also called <pre-line>) is a non-visible line, in which the PPU gets things ready for the upcoming frame
  - during this time, it resets some important status flags
  - more on that later! 🔜
