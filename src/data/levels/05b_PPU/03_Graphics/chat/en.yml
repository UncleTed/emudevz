  - all NEEES graphics are conformed by <tiles>
  - a tile is an 8x8 pixel grid
  - <{tile_grayscale.png;8x8}>
  - and 8x8 is a small size, so one tile usually represents a part of a bigger picture
  - they are all stored in the cartridge's ðŸ‘¾  <CHR-ROM> (or <CHR-RAM>)
  - <{tiles_grayscale.png;30x30}>
  responses:
  - what about the colors? [colors]

colors:
  messages:
  - tiles can use 4 colors (2 bits per pixel), but they don't know what <actual colors> they'll have
  - they only know that a certain pixel is "color 0", "color 1", "color 2" or "color 3"
  - color is added in runtime by the use of <palettes>, which define what each color should be
  - "after applying a palette, tiles can look like this:"
  - <{tile.png;8x8}>
  - <{tiles.png;30x30}>
  responses:
  - so, with the use of a palette, can I apply any color? [anycolor]

anycolor:
  messages:
  - well... no
  - the NEEES can only show 64 different well-defined colors
  - <{colors.png}>
  - so each palette references this catalog
  responses:
  - tell me more about tiles [moreabouttiles]

  - a frame is made by one <background> and multiple <sprites>
  - <{full.png;30x30}>
  - the background is static, but games can move it by pixels through scrolling
  - <{background.png;30x30}>
  - sprites are objects that can be moved or flipped easily
  - <{sprites.png;30x30}>
  - both things use tiles to render
  responses:
  - ah [end]
