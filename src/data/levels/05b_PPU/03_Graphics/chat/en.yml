  - a brief intro to NEEES graphics! 🖌️
  - all graphics are composed of 🕊️  tiles
  - a tile is an ~8x8~ pixel grid
  - <{tile_grayscale.png;8x8}>
  - and ~8x8~ is a really small size! so one tile usually represents a part of a bigger picture
  - they are all stored in 🕊️ 📖  pattern tables, inside the cartridge's 👾  CHR-ROM (or CHR-RAM)
  - <{tiles_grayscale.png;30x30}>
  responses:
  - what about the colors? 🌈 [colors]

colors:
  messages:
  - tiles can use 4 colors (~2~ bits per pixel), but they don't know what <actual colors> they'll have
  - they only know that a certain pixel is "color 0", "color 1", "color 2" or "color 3"
  - color is added at runtime by the use of 🎨  palettes, which define what each color should be
  - "after applying a palette, tiles can look like this:"
  - <{tile.png;8x8}>
  - <{tiles.png;30x30}>
  responses:
  - so, with the use of a palette, can I apply any color? 🤔 [anycolor]

anycolor:
  messages:
  - well... no 😅
  - the NEEES can only display 64 different well-defined colors
  - <{colors.png}>
  - so each palette references entries from this catalog, known as the master palette
  responses:
  - tell me more about tiles 👀 [moreabouttiles]

  - a frame is made by one 🏞️  background and multiple 🛸  sprites
  - <{full.png;30x30}>
  - 🏞️  the background is static, but games can move it through scrolling
  - <{background.png;30x30}>
  - 🛸  sprites are objects that can be easily moved or flipped, drawn on top of the background
  - <{sprites.png;30x30}>
  - both things use tiles to render
  responses:
  - ah, gotcha [enough]

  messages:
  - we'll analyze the memory structures for tiles, backgrounds, and sprites later
  - but now you have an idea of how graphics are arranged on the screen ✨
  - "here's a summary..."
  - 🏞️  there's a background image
  - 🛸  there are multiple sprites
  - 🕊️  both use tiles to render
  - 👾  all tiles are in CHR-ROM or CHR-RAM, with no color
  - 🎨  color is given through palettes
  - 👑 🎨  palettes reference entries of a fixed 64-color master palette
  - "I'll write about this, with more details, here: 📄  ~/docs/ppu/definitions.en.md~"
  responses:
  - awesome [end]
