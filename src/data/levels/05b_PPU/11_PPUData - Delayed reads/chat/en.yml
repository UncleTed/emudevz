  - remember how games write to VRAM?
  - <{PPUAddr_PPUData.png}>
  - they also can <read> from VRAM, by reading from 📦  ~PPUData~ instead of writing
  - "this operation also increments the address in 📍  ~PPUAddr~, and has a little quirk:"
  - all reads are <delayed> by 1, except for the <Palette RAM> section and its mirrors
  responses:
  - how can we implement the delay? ⌛ [delay]

  - simple, when a <read> is requested, you read into a buffer, but then you return the <previous value> of that buffer
