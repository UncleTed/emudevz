  - we'll store our image data in something called <frame buffer>
  - it's basically a big array with the color of each pixel
  - each element is a 32-bit number __$aabbggrr__
  - "\"aa\" represents the opacity (in our NEEES it's always $FF)"
  - "\"bb\", \"gg\" and \"rr\" represent the amount of <blue>, <green> y <red>"

    üìö  _-_ok, let's add this to your PPU's constructor:
      ```javascript
      this.frameBuffer = new Uint32Array(256*240);
      // fill the first 120 rows with red:
      for (let i = 0; i < 256 * 120; i++)
        this.frameBuffer[i] = 0xff0000ff;```_--_
  - _-_modify your `step` method so it receives an `onFrame` callback_--_
  - |-
    _-_then, every time you detect a new frame (right after ```javascript this.frame++;```), call it with the frame buffer, like this:
      ```javascript onFrame(this.frameBuffer);```_--_
  - _-_try it! when loading a ROM, it should paint in red the upper half of the screen _--_üî¥
