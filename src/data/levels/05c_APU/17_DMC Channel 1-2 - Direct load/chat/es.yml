  - the 📦  DMC Channel gives games the ability to output their own samples!
  - this allows creating any waveforms, not just pulse waves, triangle waves, or noise!
  - "it has two modes of operation:"
  - "🎚️  <Direct Load>: games load a 7-bit sample directly to the APU (high quality, but CPU intensive)"
  - "🔼  <Delta Modulation>: the APU automatically decodes a DPCM stream using the _Delta Modulation_ technique, where each sample is stored as the difference (<delta>) from the previous one (low quality, but lighter)"
