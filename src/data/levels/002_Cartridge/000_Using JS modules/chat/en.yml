  - 📚  create a file in ~/code/Cartridge.js~
  - its default export should be an empty class
  - then, import that file from ~/code/index.js~
  - and export an object with only one key ("Cartridge") pointing to that class

  - export? modules? 🧐 [modules]

modules:
  messages:
  - yeah, every file is a module, and it has an <exported> value
  - that value can be any JS expression, and it can be used elsewhere by <importing> the module
  - |-
    here's some help...

    to set the export value of a module:
      ```javascript export default "A_STRING"```
      ```javascript export default { an: "object", number: 123 }```
      ```javascript export default [1, 2, 3]```
      ```javascript export default function aFunction() { }```
      ```javascript export default class SomeClass() { }```
    to import a module:
      ```javascript import aFunction from "./relative/path/to/aFunction"```
      ```javascript import SomeClass from "./relative/path/to/SomeClass"```
