  - test your program with the ⏩  button

  - remember that before writing to memory, you need to load the value on [A]
  - "and when you type literal numbers, you must prefix them with #"
  - "e.g. if you want to load a $99, it's `LDA #$99` instead of `LDA $99`"
  - "(the latter would load into [A] whatever value is in the memory address $0099)"
  responses:
  - thanks, I'll try [end]
