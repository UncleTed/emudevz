  - ok, I'll leave the rest of the mappers as <an exercise for the reader>
  - there are lots of them! ðŸ‘€
  - in fact, the iNEEES format (in its non-extended version) has support for at least 256 mappers ðŸ¤¯
  - to have parity with BrokenNEEES, you should aim for <MMC1> (mapper 1), <CNROM> (mapper 3) and <MMC3> (mapper 4)
  - there's plenty of documentation online, so go check them out!
  - bye!!
