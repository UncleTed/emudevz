  - the indexed modes...
  - time to implement them as well
  - take a look at the example pseudocode in the documentation ðŸ‘€
  - you have to be careful and apply the appropriate `byte.toU8(...)` and `byte.toU16(...)` calls
  - e.g. in the "Absolute,X" mode, if the <input> is $FFFF and [X] is 3, the <output> must be $0002 (not $10002)
