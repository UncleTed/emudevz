    _-_implement these methods:_--_
    **push(value)**:
      __-> writes <value> to the memory address <currentAddress>, then decrements <sp>__
    **pop()**:
      __-> increments <sp> and returns the result of reading <currentAddress> from memory__
  - _-_the <currentAddress> always equals $0100 (where the stack lives in RAM), plus the value in [SP]_--_
  - |-
    _-_when you finish, add a new stack instance to the CPU:
      ```javascript this.stack = new Stack(this.memory, this.sp);```_--_
