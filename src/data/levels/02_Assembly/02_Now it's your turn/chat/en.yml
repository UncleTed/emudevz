  - remember that before writing to memory, you need to load the value into [A]
  - so it's a two-step operation
  - <{LDA_STA.png}>
  - "also, when you type literal numbers, you must prefix them with #"
  - "e.g. if you want to load a $99 into [A], it's `LDA #$99` instead of `LDA $99`"
  - <{LDA_immediate.png}>
  - "(otherwise, it would load into [A] whatever value is in the memory address $0099)"

  responses:
  - thanks, I'll try [end]
