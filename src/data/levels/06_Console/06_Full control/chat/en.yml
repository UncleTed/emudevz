  messages:
  - I'm actually...
  - the creator of BrokenNEEES
  - it has been rough since <AI> took over and most manual programming efforts died
  - I miss <manual programming>, a lot
  - I wanted to make someone out there enjoy programming like I do
  - then I found you, your interest in emulation made me want to help
  - the emulator isn't actually <broken>, those were bugs I planted on purpose 😅
  - the goal was to have an excuse to teach someone something I love
  - that is why I always have some code ready to nudge you forward
  - I hope you are not mad
  responses:
  - why fake bugs? [why]
  - so, what now? [next]

why:

  - you don't learn the soul of an emulator by reading, you learn it by doing!

  responses:
  - (*) so your "real NEEES" was also your emulator? [real]
  - fine, what is next? [next]
