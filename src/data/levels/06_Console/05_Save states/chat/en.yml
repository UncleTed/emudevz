  messages:
  - 📸  <save states> are just snapshots of the execution state, so they are trivial to implement
  - you just have to serialize your emulator's current state into a structure (like an object)
  - and be able to restore it from a existing snapshot
  - to avoid coupling every component with each other, though, it'd be advisable to let each class know how to serialize itself
  - for example, `CPU::getSaveState()` could serialize just the 🧠  CPU state, and `APU::getSaveState()` the 🔊  APU state
