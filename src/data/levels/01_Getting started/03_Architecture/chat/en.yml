  - so... apparently, this thing has 3 main components that work pretty much independently from each other
  - "these are: 🧠  CPU, 🖥️  PPU, and 🔊  APU"

  - "in order to play games, you must connect two pieces of hardware:"
  - 💾  a cartridge (the game itself!)
  - 🎮  an 8-button gamepad
  responses:
  - 🧠  tell me about the CPU [cpu]
  - 🖥️  tell me about the PPU [ppu]
  - 🔊  tell me about the APU [apu]
  - ⏭️  what's the best way to start? [start]

  - it's the Central Processing Unit
  - reads a game's code and executes its instructions
  - like the one in your computer, but <several> times slower
  - it has access to a 2 KiB bank of WRAM (Work RAM)
  responses:
  - and where's the game's code? [thecode]
  - ...main

  - it's the Picture Processing Unit
  - draws graphics by putting pixels on the screen
  - in the magnificent resolution of 256x240!
  - and it has access to a 2 KiB bank of VRAM (Video RAM)
  responses:
  - and where are those graphics located? [thegraphics]

  - it's the Audio Processing Unit
  - handles sound, producing audio waves
  - like square waves, triangle waves, noise, and even custom samples!
  - it outputs a stream of 44100 samples per second

  - ...main

  messages:
  - to emulate the CPU, we'll have to interpret games' code
  - they're written in assembly, so you need to study that first
  - let's jump into it!
  - are you ready?
  responses:
  - ok let's go [end]
