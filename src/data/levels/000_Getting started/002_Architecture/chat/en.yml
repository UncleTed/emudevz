  - so... apparently, this thing has 3 main components that work pretty much independently from each other
  - "these are: 💻  CPU, 🖥️  PPU, and 🔊  APU"
  - in order to play games, you must connect two pieces of hardware
  - a cartridge (the game itself!) and an 8-button gamepad
  responses:
  - (k) 💻  tell me about the CPU [cpu]
  - (k) 🖥️  tell me about the PPU [ppu]
  - (k) 🔊  tell me about the APU [apu]
  - (l) what's the best way to start? [start]

cpu:
  messages:
  - it's the Central Processing Unit
  - reads a game's code and executes its instructions
  - like the one in your computer, but <several> times slower
  - it has access to a 2KiB bank of WRAM (Work RAM)
  responses:
  - and where's the game's code? [thecode]
  - ...main

thecode:
  messages:
  - in the cartridge!
  - specifically, in a chip called PRG-ROM (Program ROM)
  responses:
  - ...main

ppu:
  messages:
  - it's the Picture Processing Unit
  - draws graphics by putting pixels on the screen
  - and it has access to a 2KiB bank of VRAM (Video RAM)
  responses:
  - and where are those graphics located? [thegraphics]
  - ...main

thegraphics:
  messages:
  - in the cartridge! :)
  - specifically, in a chip called CHR-ROM (Character ROM)
  responses:
  - ...main

apu:
  messages:
  - it's the Audio Processing Unit
  - handles sound, producing audio waves
  - I'm still learning about this one
  responses:
  - ...main

start:
  messages:
  - we'll first study the assembly language
  - are you ready?
  responses:
  - let's go [end]
