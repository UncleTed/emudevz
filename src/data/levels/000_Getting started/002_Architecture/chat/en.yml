  - so... apparently, this thing has 3 main components that work pretty much independently from each other
  - "these are: 💻  CPU, 🖥️  PPU, and 🔊  APU"
  - in order to play games, you must connect two pieces of hardware
  - a cartridge (the game itself!) and a 8-button gamepad
  responses:
  - 💻  tell me about the CPU [end]
  - 🖥️  tell me about the PPU [end]
  - 🔊  tell me about the APU [end]
  - 💾  tell me about the cartridges [end]
  - ok [end]
