NTSC NEEES PPU Tests
--------------------
These ROMs test a few aspects of the NTSC NEEES PPU operation. They have been
tested on an actual NEEES and all give a passing result. I wrote them to verify
that my NEEES emulator's PPU was working properly.

Each ROM runs several tests and reports a result code on screen and by beeping
a number of times. A result code of 1 always indicates that all tests were
passed; see below for the meaning of other codes for each test.

The main source code for each test is included, and most tests are clearly
divided into sections. Some of the common support code is included, but not
all, since it runs on a custom setup. Contact me if you want to assemble the
tests yourself.
