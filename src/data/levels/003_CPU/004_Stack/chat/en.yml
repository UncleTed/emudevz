  - remember the stack? ðŸ“š
  - create a new class for it
  - it should receive the `memory` and `sp` from the CPU, as it will have to interact with them

    implement these methods:
    ~push(value)~:
      writes ~value~ to <current address>, then decrements <sp>
    ~pop()~:
      increments <sp>
      returns the content of <current address>
  - the <current address> always equals $0100 (where the stack lives in RAM), plus [SP]
