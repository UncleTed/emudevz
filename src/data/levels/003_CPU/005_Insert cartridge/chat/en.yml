  - we need to glue our 💾  `Cartridge` and our 🖥️  `CPU`

  - how? [how]

  messages:
  - 📚  create a `NEEES` class that receives the ROM bytes (and add it to ~/code/index.js~)
  - it should instantiate a new `Cartridge` using those bytes, and assign it to a `cartridge` property
  - it should also instantiate the `CPU`, passing the cartridge as an argument, and save it into a `cpu` property
  - the `CPU` should pass the cartridge to `CPUMemory`'s constructor
  - in `CPUMemory`, map the range $8000-$BFFF to <PRG-ROM> (remember you can obtain the bytes by calling ```javascript cartridge.prg()```)
  - don't call ```javascript prg()``` multiple times, as it would affect performance
