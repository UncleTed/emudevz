  - remember the stack? ðŸ§±
  - ðŸ“š  create a new class for it
  - it should receive the `memory` and `sp` from the CPU, as it will have to interact with them

    implement these methods:
    **push(value)**:
      __writes <value> to <currentAddress>, then decrements <sp>__
    **pop()**:
      __increments <sp> and returns the content of <currentAddress>__
  - the <currentAddress> always equals $0100 (where the stack lives in RAM), plus the value in [SP]
  - |-
    when you finish, add a new stack instance to the CPU:
    ```javascript this.stack = new Stack(this.memory, this.sp);```
