  - I'll exemplify this by implementing 3 common instructions in a particular format

  - alright... how many arithmetic instructions are? [howmany]

  messages:
  - there are 12 of them, but I already coded 3 for you! 😎
  - and some of them are pretty similar
  - 📚  create an object following the same format as the example
  - implement all of the 12 arithmetic instructions on it
  - and export it under the `instructions` key in ~/code/index.js~
  - you need docs regarding what should each instruction do
  - so check out 📄  ~/docs/cpu_instructions.en.md~
