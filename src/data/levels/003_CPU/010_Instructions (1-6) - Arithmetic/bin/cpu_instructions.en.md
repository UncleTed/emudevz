| `ADC` | Add with Carry        | 🔢  | Adds the contents of a `value` to `[A]` together with the Carry flag (`[A]` = `[A]` + `value` + `C`), updating the `Z` and `N` flags.<br><br>The `C` and `V` flags are set in case of unsigned and signed overflow respectively.<br><br>Unsigned overflow occurs when the result is >= `256` (use `byte.overflows(...)`).<br>Signed overflow occurs when `Positive + Positive = Negative` or `Negative + Negative = Positive`. |
