  - if this was a weird game in which you have to code an emulator
  - this would be a <final boss> 👹
  - ~NEEEStest~ is a homebrew that thoroughly tests CPU operation
  - it was created by someone called <kevtris>
  - I'll run your emulator and log every instruction
  - comparing each line against a "golden log"

  - a log file which documents the result of running that test ROM, but created by an emulator that was proven to work correctly ✔️
  - "it has -in order-: the [PC], the bytecode, the decompiled assembly, the state of all registers, and the cycle counter"
  - so far, I only ran basic tests to your code
  - this will go through all type of corner cases, verifying that your CPU is solid
  - if you find discrepancies, you'll have to figure out the cause, or ask for help online
  - use the ⏩  button and reach the end of the golden log!
