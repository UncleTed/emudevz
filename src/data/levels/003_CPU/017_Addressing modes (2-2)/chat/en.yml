  - the indexed modes...
  - time to implement them too!
  - take a look at the example pseudocode inside the documentation ðŸ‘€
  - you have to be careful and apply the proper `byte.toU8(...)` and `byte.toU16(...)` calls
  - e.g. in the "Absolute,X" mode, if the <input> is $FFFF and [X] is 3, the <output> must be 2 (and not $10002)
