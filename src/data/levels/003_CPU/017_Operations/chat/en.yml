  - "\"opcode\" stands for \"operation code\""
  - so... what's an <operation>? 🤔
  - it's the union of an 📖  <instruction> and an 📍  <addressing mode>
  - "let's list some examples:"
  - "`STA $4080`: the `STA` instruction using the `ABSOLUTE` mode"
  - "  => opcode $8D"
  - "`STA $30,X`: the `STA` instruction with the `INDEXED_ABSOLUTE_X` mode"
  - "  => opcode $9D"
  - "`STA ($55),Y`: the `STA` instruction with the `INDIRECT_INDEXED`"
  - "  => opcode $91"
  responses:
  - that means `STA` can have different opcodes depending on the addressing mode? [multiple]

  - exactly that ✔️
  - "here's a function that defines all the opcodes for you:"
  - 📄  ~/lib/operations.js~
  - you only need to call it, passing the `instructions` and the `addressingModes` objects
  - "📚  add the following property to your `CPU`:"
  - "```javascript this.operations = opcodes(instructions, addressingModes);```"
