  - your CPU memory has to be connected to everything
  - for example, to map <PRG-ROM> into memory, you need to connect a ðŸ§   mapper
  - but so far, we've only coded a few components, and ZERO mappers ðŸ˜…
  responses:
  - so, what's a mapper? [mapper]

mapper:
  messages:
  - they're circuits inside the cartridge that control how the ROM data is read by the console
  - each game uses a specific mapper
  - the more mappers your emulator supports, the more games are compatible ðŸ‘¾
  responses:
  - then I guess we need to code at least one mapper, right? [onemapper]

onemapper:
  messages:
  - nah, <BrokenNEEES> supports the most common mappers (0-4)
  - and surprisingly, they all work! so you'll be using those for now
  - (I'll teach you how to implement them in the Mappers chapter, so you can add more)
  - now let's focus on receiving a bunch of <devices>
  - we'll map them later!
