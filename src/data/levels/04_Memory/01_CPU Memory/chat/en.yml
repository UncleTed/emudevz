  - let's quickly recap the NEEES memory scheme
  - the CPU has 2 KiB of RAM 🐏
  - but memory addresses range from $0000 to $FFFF (65535)
  - so the full addressable space would be 64 KiB
  responses:
  - if only 2 KiB are actual RAM, what's in the other 62 KiB? 🤨 [other62]

other62:
  messages:
  - other things, like RAM mirrors, memory-mapped I/O, and the cartridge data
  - 🔗  everything is connected to the memory!
  - that's how the machine code interacts with the devices
  - the memory map has a very specific structure, see 📄  ~/docs/cpu/cpu_memory.en.md~
  responses:
  - (*) what's "memory-mapped I/O"? 🗺️ [io]
  - 👌  I see... what do I need to implement? [implement]

io:
  messages:
  - a scheme in which memory addresses are connected to physical devices
  - for example...
  - reading $4016 will read the 🎮  controller's pressed buttons
  - writing the 🖥️  PPU registers at $2000-$2007 will modify the screen
  - writing the 🔊  APU registers at $4000-$4013 will produce sounds
  - reading $8000 will probably read the first byte of <PRG-ROM> from the 💾  cartridge

  - what about the mirrored bytes? 📐 [help]

  messages:
  - I handled that for you, as that part can be a bit tricky
  - basically, calling `read(0x0802)` should return the same as `read(0x0002)`
  - and calling `write(0x0802, value)` should have the same effect as calling `write(0x0002, value)`
  - that's why the range $0800-$1FFF is called 🚽  <a mirror> of $0000-$07FF
  - "here's an example with the other mirror range in $2008:"
